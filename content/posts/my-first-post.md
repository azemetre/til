Hugo seems interesting, markdown renderer for a static blog. Theming does seem a
tad confusing, but you can't beat having a blog hosted on github pages so
easily.

In the past I've created static site generators with python and currently use [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/)
for my [personal blog](https://www.azemetre.com/). Thought it would be nice to
get familiar with github pages and create a basic blog out of it too!
