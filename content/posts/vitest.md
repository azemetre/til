This week at work I had the task of updating our jest versions, rather than
dealing with the paint of typescript, jest, ts-jest, and all the associated
woes. I thought it was time to port the test runner to something else.

[vitest](https://vitest.dev/) thus far seems very quick and fast. Wasn't hard at
all to make the transition.
